#Choose your path.

##Individual projects
Now is when you decide what to focus on for the rest of the quarter. Now you choose your individual project. You may choose to create a series of smaller projects all focused around a certain type of content and make a site to house them all. You may want to create one larger project with a specific theme. The decision is yours.

###Here's some guidelines:
- Your project must involve editing code, and must build on what you've learned so far.  
- You may want to consider what sort of projects a news organization would find most useful. More importantly, consider what kinds of news-focused projects people in a community would find most useful, informational, and/or entertaining.  

###Some prep for completing your project:
- Make a list of the types of information people need to know. _Include links to a few examples._
- Make a list of types of content you can use on the web. _Include links to a few examples._
- Make a list of ways you can distribute content on the web. _Include links to a few examples._
- Mash up these three lists by identifying which types of information are best served by which content types and delivery methods.
- Use these lists to help you decide what you're most interested in.
- Do research to determine what open source software will help you build your project.
- Create a hand-drawn sketch of what you think the various views of the project will look like.
- Write a proposal that explains the functionality of the project.

##reading and other stuff:
- Read chapter four of _Code Simplicity_.
- Read chapter four of _The Design of Everyday Things_.

#TO TURN IN:
- Post the lists you created in preparing for your project.
- A blog post that describes the goal of your project, the open source tools you expect you will use to complete the project, a screenshot of the sketches you did of how the project will look, and a description of the functionality of the project.
