#HELLO.  

##Weekly meetings:
Mondays at 1 p.m.    

##When assigned work is due:
Weekly assignments are due on the following Monday. So, something assigned in week one is due Monday of week two.

##How to turn in work:
Blog about it. In week one you'll set up a blog to use for the contract. I recommend tumblr.com. PLEASE USE TUMBLR.  
Write about what you're working on, include screenshots and/or video, and include links to projects that are available online.  
At the end of the quarter you'll be expected to complete a portfolio that comprehensively accounts for all of your work, displayed in a way that is fun and useful.
