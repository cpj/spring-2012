##week 3
#Javascript. Gifs.

##animated gifs.
We all love these. Does anyone not love these.  
You will make three of them. 
###Three animated gifs.  
- One of them can be anything you want. Do this one first. make it simple.
- One must tell a story, must convey true information.
- One must be large, about 1500x1500 pixels. You will use this later.

For all three: you can use photos, illustrations, frames from videos, whatever. Focus on using your own images.  

##javascript:
- Complete the [week 2 courses from codeyear.com](http://www.codecademy.com/curricula/code-year/units/2)
- You will learn to use a jquery plugin to provide new features to a design.

### jquery plugin: backstretch.js
This is a really great jquery plugin.  
First, a little background: jquery is a library that makes it easier to use javascript to work with the html elements on your site.
To get started learning jquery, go to jqfundamentals.com.  

## refactor your portfolio site
**You will do three things to refactor your portfolio site:**  
- Use sinatra views rather than a static index.html page.  
- Use jquery.backstretch.js on the layout view. And yse the animated gif you created as the image being used as the background.      
- Uevise the css so that the text has a semi-transparent background over the photo background of the site.

##recap: do some blog posts, take some screenshots, the usual.  
- Write extensively – as much as you can – about your end goals in building websites for sharing information. Why are you interested in journalism? In the web? Describe the gap between your goals and the knowledge and skills you have. Describe how you can best help others to close the gap between their knowledge and skills and the goals they have with journalism and web development.
