###week 1.  
#fun. design. vagrant. git. heroku.  

##blog.
Start a blog, or use an existing one. I recommend tumblr.com. Tag all your posts for the contract with something like spring2012 (or whatever, just make sure you tag every post for the contract the same each time).Send me the link to the page of your blog for that tag.  

Do one blog post at the end of the week discussing what you’re struggling with most so far, what you’re enjoying, and come up with as many ideas as you can about how what you’re learning could be applied to the publications of a news organization.  

Also: take notes about everything, and take screen shots of everything. Set up a folder on the computer you use to store screenshots of what you're working on. Every day, take at least one screen shot and write some notes about what you're working on. Blog that stuff.  

##image macros.
Did you know that the name for lolcats, for images with overlaid text, is image macros?! [Here's some proof](http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-name-for-lolcats-and-other-photos-illustrations-with-catchphrases), and [some more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro).  

This week you will create 10 image macros using Adobe Illustrator. 

For the first five, choose an existing meme. Use the standard photo or illustration and add text. Feel free to experiment with mashing it up with other memes.

For the second five, come up with something new. Maybe it’s about Evergreen, or Olympia, or a video game you like to play. But you must create the images. Take photos or draw illustrations. Do five image macros for this new meme you’re creating, or make five completely different ones. Just make sure that you are creating something new. And of course, sometimes creating something new means combining things we’re already familiar with and doing totally unexpected things with them. But obviously, doing some ol’ lolcats isn’t good enough for this part of the assignment.

##start your portfolio site.
###There will be a few steps to setting up your portfolio site:  
- 1. Set up a vagrant box that you’ll use to work on your portfolio site. Instructions.  
- 2. Fork a github repository to use as a starterkit for your portfolio site. Instructions.  
- 3. Create a basic site (with only test content) and push it to heroku.com. Instructions.  

##read and watch some stuff:
- Read the first chapter of _The Design of Everyday Things_.
  - Be aware: this book uses old examples. Your academic duty is to think about the concepts in the book and apply them to building news-focused websites.
- Read [this question and all its answers on quora.com](http://www.quora.com/Learning-to-Program/I-get-very-frustrated-when-code-that-I-write-behaves-unexpectedly-scream-shout-blame-myself-for-being-a-failure-give-up-etc-I-think-this-is-impacting-my-ability-to-concentrate-on-my-work-due-to-the-negativity-I-try-maintaining-calm-however-the-stress-always-seems-to-overcome-me-Is-there-any-way-to).
- Watch and listen as a [game designer describes the history of storytelling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyyrW8bIk6M&feature=relmfu), and talks about how storytelling online will evolve in unexpected ways. Think about what this can mean for journalism. If the first novels disclaimed "this is not fiction", and the first movies conveyed "this is not a movie", what, in your estimation, have news websites been saying they are not?
- Ben Huh. CEO of the Cheezburger Network. Cool dude. [Watch and listen to this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11s2gFUGWz8) he did about how his first company was a failure, and how it ultimately helped him start I Can Has Cheezburger. Watch this to know the history to the Cheezburger Network, to get a sense of the work it took, to understand what drove Huh to create some awesome blogs. Think about how to apply some of the ideas in this talk to your work.  
- Also check out [this other Ben Huh talk about internet culture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gBgyIWSEoU).

# to recap: work to complete before Monday of week 2:
- email a link to your blog.  
- blog posts for 10 image macros. 5 based on existing memes, 5 based on something new.  
- a blog post with screenshots of the process of setting up a vagrant box, forking the github repository, and working with git to push your site to heroku, and a link to your portfolio site on heroku.com  
- a blog post about what you've accomplished, what you're struggling with, and how to apply your learning to a news publication. Include in this blog post discussion of the quora q&a about failure and frustration, the Ben Huh talks about internet culture and about failure and learning, and the Elan Lee talk about the evolution of storytelling.
